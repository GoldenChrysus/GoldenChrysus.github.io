# Changelog

## 0.22.0-alpha

**Released: 2020-08-16**

### Bug Fixes
- N/A

### Features
- Settings page now works independently of the main overlay (parser)
    - Previously, settings would only save if you opened the settings page from the parser and kept the parser open
    - Can navigate directly to `https://goldenchrysus.github.io/ffxiv/ember-overlay/#/settings/about` without the parser open to make changes
    - Useful in programs like Streamlabs OBS where pasting usually does not work so settings are difficult to import; can modify settings directly in the Browser Source now
- Added setting to prioritize party at top of player list
    - Intended for alliance raids, your party will be listed before all other raid members
    - Rankings and performance bars will still be relative to the entire raid's performance
    - Accessible at Settings > Player Table > Prioritize Party Members at Top of List or Settings > Raid View > Prioritize Party Members at Top of List

### UI Changes
